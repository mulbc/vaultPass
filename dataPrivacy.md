# Privacy Policy for VaultPass

\_Last Updated: 21-Nov-2024

Welcome to VaultPass! We are committed to maintaining the trust and confidence of the users of our browser extension. This Privacy Policy provides detailed information on how we collect, use, and protect your personal information when you use VaultPass.

## About VaultPass

VaultPass is a browser extension designed to leverage HashiCorp Vault as a credential storage and password manager for teams. It simplifies the process of managing login data for multiple users in an enterprise setting.

## Information We Collect

VaultPass handles the following types of information:

1. **Login Data**: This includes usernames and temporary tokens.
2. **Configuration Data**: Settings and preferences set within the extension.
3. **Browser Storage**: We save the username, temporary token, and configuration within your browser's local storage. Some of the information is syncronized between your browser instances. This is done by your browser if logged into your browser vendor's accounting system and enabling syncronization. This is not a feature of VaultPass.

**Note**: VaultPass does not store passwords - neither syncronized nor locally.

## How We Use Your Information

The information collected by VaultPass is used solely for the purpose of providing the functionality of the extension. This includes:

- Storing and retrieving login credentials and configuration settings.
- Ensuring a personalized and efficient user experience.

## Data Security

We take the security of your data seriously. VaultPass does not transmit any of your data externally itself. All information is stored locally on your browser and is not accessible to the extension authors.

## Open Source Software

VaultPass is an open-source project. The source code is publicly available for review and contribution at [VaultPass GitHub Repository](https://github.com/mulbc/vaultPass).

## No Tracking Policy

We do not track users of VaultPass. There is no collection of personal information, browsing history, or any form of tracking implemented in this extension.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We encourage users to frequently check this page for any changes. Your continued use of VaultPass after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
